# FFT_Gan
This code represents a new approach to synthetic SZ maps generation, using generative AI.
The architecture will be a GAN and will try to generate the Fourier space of the images.
The training will be progressive, in the sense that higher frequency will be feed into the network after it has been trained at lower level of information.
